APCS Spring 2015 Konstantinovich Period 7

Project Description:

This will be a program that lets users simulate electrical circuits. They will be able to drag components of their circuit (e.g. batteries, resistors) from a menu and connect them with "wires" by clicking on the components.

To-Do List:

Menu + Drag and drop

Batteries and Resistors

Wires

Capacitors and other basic circuit components

Logic Circuit functionality

Voltmeters and Ammeters

Instruction Manual

Dev Log:

5/26 During class: created main class and component class.

5/27 When I SHOULD BE SLEEPING: added the menuOption class and battery subclasses, started on display functions.

5/27 During class: created first branch, Ishraq is now working on menu.

5/27 Home: "finished" click and drag functionality, not sure if processing has stacks or not.

6/something (because I forgot to update) Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBounds: -1 Exception that happened during class...oops

6/14 Finished buttons
Weekend of 6/12: Continued working on connection logic and trees and having effects to show connection. Was unable to complete due to some complications in the previous setup of how connections were done. Can look at code to see what was done.
